# Essence Hunt - A Web Game Project About Managing Your Portfolio

## Introduction
Welcome to Essence Hunt! I created this web game as an upgrade to my previous capstone project, Treasure Hunt. 

This project was meant to be a challenge for myself to build my own fully functional game, applying what I learnt about JavaScript and React from The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/).

The total time spent on this project is about 55+ hours, which included the time to ideate, plan, build and test. In this 55 hours, I have learnt so much and became more comfortable about working with React.

Please try out the game and help me improve it by letting me know your feedback! You can reach out to me at my email: nigelyyz@yahoo.com.sg.

## Game Information
### Purpose
The game is supposed to mimic what it's like managing a financial portfolio, with different seeds and plants representing different types of investments. 

The differences are that you don't need to use real money and you don't actually purchase the investment because you will need to find them (opportunities).

Ultimately, the outcome of this game depends highly on both luck and skill. It doesn't necessarily make you an 'expert' if you manage to complete the game faster than others, because what matters is how you play it.

Most importantly, I do hope that you have fun and enjoy playing the game!

### Objective
The objective of this game is to earn as much essence, which serves as currency as well as indication of your progress, as much as possible.

### Win condition
I have added a win condition of 1 million essence as a benchmark, but you can still continue beyond that if you wish!

### Strategy
You can either stick to a single strategy or just experiment around to find out what kind of strategy is best for you! At the end of the day, even though the game relies mostly on luck, a little strategising might help you go a long way!

### Instructions & Help
Most of the information are in the game guide, which is indicated by a '?' button at the bottom right of the screen.

### Bugs
There are still a few minor bugs that I had discovered, but should not impact your gameplay too greatly. If you discover any gamebreaking bugs, do reach out to me at my email stated above.

1. Save and Load features not working very well. May cause grid to display wrong number of cells or not updating. Minimise usage if possible.
2. UI not compatible with mobile web browsers.
